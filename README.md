AI Student Assistant Chatbox
Overview
The AI Student Assistant Chatbox is an interactive web application designed to assist students with various academic tasks and inquiries. This chatbox leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to student queries, providing support on a range of topics including homework help, scheduling, and general academic advice.

The application is built using a combination of modern technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Backend: Python with Flask
NLP: spaCy (or alternatively, Hugging Face transformers)
Database: SQLite (or PostgreSQL/MySQL for more extensive deployments)
Features
Interactive Chat Interface: A user-friendly chat interface where students can type their questions or requests.
Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes NLP to interpret and generate responses based on user input.
Academic Assistance: Provides help with common academic tasks such as homework questions, scheduling, and general advice.
User Authentication (Optional): Allows students to log in and keep track of their interactions (can be extended for personalized experiences).
Data Storage: Maintains a log of interactions for review and improvement of responses.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML for structuring the chat interface.
CSS for styling and layout.
JavaScript for handling user interactions and API communication.
Backend:

Python with Flask for creating the RESTful API.
spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks.
Database:

SQLite for lightweight storage (alternative databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL can be used).
